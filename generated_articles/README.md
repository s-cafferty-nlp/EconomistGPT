# EconomistGPT: AI to Write Articles of the Economist

## The idea here was to use episode titles as prompts in order to generate articles of The Economist. This was a great exercise for understanding the strengths and limitations of decoder architectures.

## Notes on Output: GPTs are spectacular at generating realistic text. The jig is up quite quickly though, when it becomes clear that GPT output contains limited internal logic. Yes, this technology is amazing. Also yes, the hype is excruciating.
