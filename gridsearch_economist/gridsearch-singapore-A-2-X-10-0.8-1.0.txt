The new law also gives states more leeway to 
allow local governments to regulate farm- 
ing. It will allow local governments to set up 
farms that are not licensed by the state, but 
allow them to sell their land to foreign firms. 

The new law will also make it harder for local governments to 
make decisions on how to regulate farms. In 
the past, governments could have taken the lead 
in regulating farms by issuing permits for them to grow, sell or 
grow crops. But in the past they had been in charge of regulating them. 

Now the government will have a more important role. The 
new law will allow states to set up local authorities to 
prove that farms are safe, provide health care and pay farmers 
a tax on their earnings. It will also allow the government to 
monitor farm activity and collect information on how much farmers earn 
from farming, how much they are raising or selling and how much 
they are selling. 

The new law will also make it easier for states to ban certain kinds of 
farming. It will also make it easier for them to ban local governments from 
regulating farm-related activities
