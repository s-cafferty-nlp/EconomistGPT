ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: SINGAPORE


TEXT OUTPUT:A new generation of techies is 
growing up in Silicon Valley and beyond. They are 
more entrepreneurial than ever, and their 
idea for success is a mix of business acumen and 
business-driven innovation. The next wave of 
intellectuals will have to be more diverse, but they can still build 
a company with the same talent, drive the right products, 
and innovate at the same speed, says Brian 
Walsh, founder of Canyons, an online e-commerce firm. 

The future is bright. As startups grow, so too will 
their skills. In the early days of the internet, there was 
little demand for skilled workers. But as technology 
becomes more sophisticated, the need for skilled people 
increasingly becomes clear. Some entrepreneurs believe that 
it could help them make better use of existing talent. 

That may sound like a fantasy, but it is not entirely unrealistic. 

In recent years many companies have found that hiring 
the right person to fill out a role has been easier than persuading 
workers to do so themselves. Many firms now offer full-time positions 
that provide flexible work environments and a broad range of experience. This 
has led to the rise of startups such as Uber, which is 
making its way into the world of cloud computing. And the number of 
startups investing in venture capital has doubled over the past year. 

Startups also have a chance to create jobs. Their ideas and 
customers can change industries faster than anyone else. 

Some entrepreneurs think they have succeeded in building something big, 
but others wonder if they have not yet achieved 
what they claim: what happens when firms get together to 
make money. In some industries startups are just starting 
to make their mark on society; in other sectors, tech is emerging 
as an exciting new area of research that could help shape the future of 
business. This article will examine how these changes may affect 
your startupâ€™s prospects in 2021.   The first step towards your success depends 
on your ability to manage your company. If you are an entrepreneur, you must be able to plan 
for your business and manage it properly. You need to understand how you operate 
and what your team needs to do to succeed, how you want your team to innovate and where you hope to invest.
