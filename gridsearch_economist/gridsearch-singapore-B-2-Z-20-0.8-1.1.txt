ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: SINGAPORE


TEXT OUTPUT:A new survey suggests that 
Chinese firms are becoming more em- 
ployable and entrepreneurial, especially among young people. This re- 
gion is not due to an ageing population; it has been con- 
sumed by a rising share of the workforce aged 25 or above being employed in tech companies like Alibaba (BAI) which have grown up around this corner from its roots as venture capitalists who built their careers at home on small investments with lots of capital into startups backed by large investment funds suchas Managers' Trusts Fund Limited and Bain Capital Management Group Ltd, both managed by Chinese investors themselves but also linked to other big VC's across Asia where they had long wanted to be global financial centres for emerging markets rather than simply taking money out through acquisitions because there was no clear market need). The growth rate since 2012 seems likely to bring some respite too after China’s rapid recovery during what will probably be another decade when many Indians see India again without having any real worries about falling prices either abroad nor domestically if trade patterns shift fast enough towards cheaper goods coming back online quickly - even though foreign demand might well rise further over time unless we do something very unexpected next year before then all these risks can become worse still soon afterwards just how much better off our economy really looks now compared with 2050* Eor 2020 almost every country could expect less import imbalances between rich countries relative cen- 
tralised economies globally including Brazil, South Korea, Germany, France and Mexico. If so little change happens until 2025 most Indian businesses would look unlikely to adapt fully yet one imagines huge shifts away from traditional manufacturing jobs may take longer lasting changes only possible under severe economic conditions caused by covid-19 A second worry looms bigger Than ever already existing talent shortages threaten local industries whose ability to compete should depend largely on skilled workers adapting rapidly within them An indepen- 
tent with a high degree of expertise in the art of business will struggle as an increasingly complex and unpredictable world has grown. In some respects this is not unusual, but its impact can be felt at home: it was once considered too costly for firms such’s most successful innovators (i) to innovate or build up their businesses;(ii) they were often inefficient because managers did not know how to manage large numbers of people who had little time left before taking over new ones. And many feared that even if companies adapted quickly enough to change these patterns—and made good choices when faced with unexpected challenges along similar lines—they would have no other choice than to reinvent themselves anew without attracting talented employees rather then risk alienating old rivals whom might try to exploit opportunities elsewhere while failing badly to find profitable ways of doing so itself The future looks bright For years there are signs that American technology giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon could all benefit greatly after decades of hard work being done right across America through innovation partnerships between tech hubs around Europe. But whether those big institutions truly follow suit depends partly on what happens next When Britain decides to leave the European Union early 2020 Mr Cameron must decide where he intends to go about his job rebuilding post-Brexit Australia's economy Eor 2021 more countries need trade deals With fewer migrants leaving EU markets less likely China wants help lifting millions out Of particular interest is growing demand globally towards energy supplies which supply levels remain relatively stable despite rising sea waves El Nino emissions risks Rising global temperatures It needs urgent action To make progress abroad This month Mrs Merkel called off plans to push ahead with talks aimed at averting catastrophic climate change. 
“We are not talking about a nuclear winter, we will talk about the next one as soon as possible", she said in Berlin on May 24th after meeting Mr de Kock and Ms Schindler of her Bavarian counterpart-to take part in preparatory work for an agreement by 2020 that could be put together under this framework The chancellor must now decide what steps he intends to pursue once his new governorship takes office In 2021 Germany may have its first green president since Hugo Chavez took power from Caracas; it has no leader who can stand up to him or fight back against radical Islamists An election campaign would boost Angela Gerhard Schroder's chances: both polls show SPD voters favour reining hard left populist Bernd Riedel over centre right anti-austerity AfD candidate Emmanuel Macron faces fierce competition among Green supporters within Europe After all these years they still lack enough support (see chart 2). For months Germans appear increasingly sceptical about their own future If Britain decides to leave the euro zone rather than accept more liberal reforms such as free movement across borders - even if some parts like southern France want closer integration into post-war America itself - Spain looks unlikely to do so without strong European institutions That leaves Greece struggling harder when Italy finds itself locked down again until reunification 2019 Many Greeks worry how long another Greek crisis might last Some think Syriza was just beginning But many see other parties looking beyond Podemos but failing to forge clear alliances Erench fears were stoked earlier today By Danes keen to keep quiet As well as German leaders wary of giving political asylum elsewhere Athens grappled closely wot late July whether there should also be any formal talks 
Austerity in a country that has been gripped by years and decades is starting to look like the future The euro zone’s recovery will take time, however. Mr Tsipras wants some big-spending cuts or more structural reforms: his centre-right government needs its votes on tax reform; it may not yet have enough new members willing to stick around for two terms before taking back control after 2019 (see chart 1 next page). This week Mrs Merkel promised Greece would do what she said must happen if her party does win an election at all this year—reforming Europe's welfare state with austerity measures could drag out negotiations until 2018. On June 29th Angela Becket told reporters outside Berlin he had no intention of leaving office unless Germany did something radical about reining off deflation again soon. In 2021 Ms Berlusconi hinted such changes still need persuading because so few Germans care much who comes round when they meet him tomorrow : He warned against being too close to Italy itself even though France already backs up both sides¬ 
as prime minister within hours anyway If Spain falls short of making progress quickly then Portugal can hardly blame Brussels nor America alone for keeping hold over them from doing everything possible to bring down rates later* It seems hard to imagine those European governments “deterring anything else since we are never going anywhere without our own national sovereignty? That sounds very hollow right now - maybe 2020 rather than 2025..
