ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: HELSINKI


TEXT OUTPUT:
AUSTRALIA’S government is in the midst of a political 
recovery. A poll by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, an independent think- 
tank, found that 54% of respondents felt it was important for 
the country to have more open borders. The number of migrants 
who had entered Australia in 2015 was just over half that 
number; this year only 16% did so, compared with 22% who 
had done so last year. 

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has made 
the case that Australia is now a beacon of hope for 
people fleeing conflict, but he is unlikely to be able 
to reverse that trend. His party, the Liberal Party of 
Malcolm Turnbull, has long been seen as a centre-right party. Its 
leader, Bill Shorten, is seen as a centrist pragmatist 
who can push through tough economic reforms, but whose party 
has struggled to make up its mind. 

Mr Turnbull has shown little interest in reopening the floodgates between 
the states and the rest of Australia. Instead, he has tried to keep the economy on track. He has 
promised to build a new coalmine by the end of 2020 to supply power to 
the north, which is home to the world’s biggest coal producer, but he has not 
done that. It will take time for it to do so. 

The result of the pandemic will be difficult to predict. But some 
other factors will play a part. Some will be worse than others. 

One is the shift in attitude towards migrants. In 2016, after years of 
overhauling Australia’s welfare system, the federal govern- 
ment changed the way it calculates 
how much asylum-seekers should be assessed. The new rules now 
make it harder to tell who is being resettled and 
when they will be granted permanent residency. 

Another is the change in the way Australia treats asylum-seekers. This 
is partly because Australia’s ageing population is expected to 
grow by 1.4m over the next 20 years. 

It will also be hard to measure how quickly people are going back 
to work, given their high costs and limited opportunities to 
work. That could affect how well the government handles the influx. 

Another factor will be the rise of online platforms. A study by the 
World Bank found that young people use them more than older ones. 

The government is already working to adapt to this shift. Last year the government 
launched a scheme to help young adults apply for work at an earlier age. 

Some states are also looking to make it easier for people with pre-existing conditions 
to get jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and other skilled workers. Others 
are looking to boost employment by encouraging families to have children. 

A third is the growing power of mobile phones. With the right mix of 
technology, they can easily become part of an integrated workforce. 

In recent years governments have tried to make sure these services 
can be used in all kinds of contexts. In some places 
they have even been able to do so without the need for 
federal licences. But in many cities, where 
the number of locusts is small, this will require 
a huge investment in new equipment and training. 

To help businesses grow, states are also taking steps to encour¬ 
age companies to innovate and improve how they manage data. The 
new federal government has created a pilot programme in San Diego 
that uses mobile data to stream data from the internet to local police stations. It 
will be the first time that the government has taken the lead 
in using it to monitor the movement of data between firms, and to 
monitor how much traffic flows into and out of each city. 

The aim is to create more efficient networks that allow the use of data at the local 
point of sale, rather than just the centre of supply chain. 

That will mean more efficient routes for people to shop, work and study, and 
much better information about what is happening on the ground. As well as reducing 
the number of people living in poverty, the new law will also give them a chance to start 
their own businesses. 

Some worry that it may be too late for those who have been waiting 
for their turn in the digital age. 

In the meantime, the federal government is investing in 
big infrastructure projects that could help speed up 
growth in the country’s second-largest economy. The Department of Energy 
is planning to launch a $5.8 billion investment fund to 
boost the electric grid, which is expected to generate 
enough electricity from renewable sources by 2021. 

The big question is how quickly these new powers can be applied, or how long it will take. A report by 
the National Infrastructure Investment Bank, an arm of the Federal Reserve, suggests that the first 
waves of this new technology will arrive in just a few years. 

That is not entirely clear. In the past two decades the Fed has made huge strides to 
build up the economy, but the pace of its progress has slowed dramatically. Its 
stimulus package last year was only the third such boost since the end of the pandemic. 

Yet some economists worry that the changes are too small to be effective at all. 
And they argue that the biggest threat to the future of the economy is not yet 
growing employment. That is because the shift to digital has been uneven: the 
first wave of data-driven innovation began in the early 1980s, when 
internet-connected devices were ubiquitous, and then spread to other industries
