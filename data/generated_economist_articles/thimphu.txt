TEXT OUTPUT:HEN the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that 
the state must provide health care to all 
people, it was a shock. The ruling is still reverberating 
through the political and social milieu. A new law 
called the “health-insurance bill” (hcbill), which will 
be debated next year by the Diet, would 
allow the state to cover all private-sector 
care. In a bid to curb its share of the burden, states 
are expected to adopt a similar plan for public-sector 
care later this year, though it will not be implemented 
in full until 2017. This is an important shift 
from a decade ago, when big firms were keen to make their 
profits more transparent. But now the stakes are high. If 
states do not follow through on this promise, there could be no 
better time to push for change than now. 

The cbbill is one of many steps to reverse decades of mismanagement 
by the govern- 
ment, which has made the state the largest shareholder in 
health insurers, among other groups. It also marks the first time 
that a government entity has been able to take over the whole industry in a 
decade. And it is likely to spur a wave of consolidation. In 2021, 
the health-care system will become the third biggest in the world after 
America and Germany. 

In the short term, however, it may have little impact. On the 
ground, the changes will prove hard to replicate. Many states have 
died without any national coverage at all, as did the Netherlands. Some 
are already in dire straits. The most recent census showed only 14,000 people 
living in the country; now it is more than 1m, up from about a tenth of 
those living in Britain. And many are still poor, with no public 
health care, education or even access to housing. 

A bigger problem is that some countries will be reluctant to accept 
these new arrivals. America has been slow to respond to them. In 
2011 the federal government imposed new rules on insurers 
and other private-sector entities that would limit their ability to charge for covid-19. It also barred 
health insurers from using tax credits to buy insurance across state lines. 

Some states are already offering subsidies for low-income patients. But they are not 
yet ready to offer those benefits to everyone else. For years 
the government has tried to get states to waive the requirements 
of having to pay out subsidies by providing vouchers for low-cost 
access to public health care, and the Affordable Care Act has made it easier 
for firms to set up shop in states where it does not require them to. 

Yet the number of Americans who are getting help is rising. In 2016, the 
number of people needing emergency care fell by nearly one-third, 
from 8.3m to 6.9m. That was an increase of 3.2% on the year before, 
but far more than any other rich country. 

States will struggle to find ways to expand access to care for those most vulnerable to covid-19, as they 
have done over the past decade or so. Many have tried to limit the amount they 
allow patients to receive, but many have been too afraid to ask doctors about the 
cost of caring for their sickest patients. The American Health Care Act, 
which began in 2009, requires insurers to cover all costs of care, such as covid-19, for 
medical records that do not meet state requirements. But some states have passed 
such reforms without a clear plan. 

The bill would also force hospitals and other providers to offer better care 
to patients who need it. It would give health-care insurers broad leeway to 
charge less for services that may be best suited to certain groups of people. 

It also calls for changes to how insurers deal with the new rules. It would 
give them more flexibility to charge higher prices for things like maternity care, 
which is often covered by insurance plans. And it would allow insurers to set their own 
rates for coverage, which can vary widely from state to state. For example, if 
a woman had to pay $50,000 per month for maternity care in California, for instance, 
it could charge $1,800 in New York. Some states now have a cap on 
when they can charge higher rates for the same service: when 
the cost of child care rises, they typically 
pay more for those services. But this will not stop states from setting 
their own caps, as some cities do. The new law, passed 
last month by the Senate, also allows states to impose 
regulatory burdens that would be too severe on small firms (see chart 1). In- 
stead, these provisions will help reduce the number of people who are at risk of 
death or serious illness; and they may even help reduce the spread of 
viral disease. 

A bigger worry for many states is how much money they will make from covid-19. Many 
are struggling to balance budgets, and most are struggling to meet rising 
costs for health care. In the past two years, states have made big changes to how they 
spend money. They have reduced red tape, expanded subsidies, tightened rules on re- 
sources of food and other goods, slashed spending on public education, 
replaced older workers with younger ones and made public schools safer. 
Some governors are doing the right thing, but others seem to be falling short of 
setting up a national strategy to deal with covid-19. As governor of Virginia, Mike Beebe 
has vowed to expand Medicaid by 2021, and he has promised to 
repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate
