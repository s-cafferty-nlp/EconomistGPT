TEXT OUTPUT:A new 
advisory board approved a plan to 
abolish the state’s public pension system, 
and replace it with a new system that will provide 
more generous benefits for its citizens. 

The governor of Texas and his fellow governors have been 
concerned about pension reform, but they are not 
willing to go along with the scheme. 

That is because they fear a vote in next year’s Republican- 
controlled House would be a blow to their re- 
gion of the governorship. In addition to the death 
penalty, many Republicans are worried about how 
much money the state will spend on education, 
health care and other services, which are essential for people 
to keep going to college, even if they do not receive pensions 
from state or federal governments. 

State legislators have long sought to limit the number of years a person can 
observe public retirement, but some Democrats, particularly in 
statehouse districts, are reluctant to accept it. They hope to pass a law that 
will require them to pay more for health care and other public 
benefits than those they earn. The bill has yet to reach the Senate 
and House of Representatives, though they may soon. 

The new systems also offer better protection for workers whose 
employers want to save money. Some employers say that they are 
increasingly likely to hire private-sector workers who get sicker 
at work rather than from state jobs. And most states are already 
using vouchers to help low-wage employees find 
work. 

In Texas, for example, there are no plans to raise wages. 

The changes are part of a broader effort by the state to 
make it easier to attract new firms. In the past few 
years, however, many cities have begun rethinking 
the way they pay workers and make their workers 
more productive. They also see the need to boost 
tax revenues by encouraging local governments to invest more in 
the education of their residents. In New Orleans, where the city is 
in the midst of a recession, the city’s tax base 
has been boosted by $1.6 billion in public funds over the past four 
months. 

Many cities and towns have tried to do just that, but some have had 
success. A study published last year by the American 
Policy Institute, a think-tank, found that in Chicago, where the 
city has struggled to attract talent since the 1980s, the proportion of 
unpaid sick days paid by people with pre-existing illnesses 
has dropped by nearly half. In Detroit, where Mr Emanuel took over as mayor 
in 2011, it has seen a sharp increase in unpaid leave, at 1.3%. In 
Washington, D.C., which is home to a thriving tech industry, the number of 
workers without pay has fallen by an average of 15% each year. 

Some cities may be taking steps to encourage other industries to adopt these 
changes. But they face obstacles. As well as increasing costs, 
new regulations and high crime levels, some cities have taken 
step back from reforming their labour laws to 
prove that workers can be fired only if they are paid 
enough to live off their families. That means that many firms 
will struggle to retain skilled workers because they cannot get sick or 
have little choice but to take time off work altogether. 

These reforms may not help everyone. Some cities are still far 
from embracing them. A new law in Illinois will require employers to 
make sure that workers do not lose benefits when they start work. This 
means that employees will not be entitled to health insurance; they must pay for 
care, food and other necessities such as public transport. It also means that they will 
have to pay a higher minimum wage to keep up with rising prices. 

Even more worryingly, most cities are making little attempt to 
make good on promises made by local governments to reduce crime. 
The city of Chicago, which has a population of just over 6m, has a record-low rate 
of murder, robbery and aggravated assault—a figure that has risen 
by about 5% every five years. Many urbanites fear that the rise 
of crime could lead to a spike in crime. So they plan to build more parks 
and greenways, including ones designed to attract tourists. 

Many of those who work there are not poor. In fact, according to 
the National Urban League, a think-tank, only 
15% of all workers have a job. But many of the 
people employed here are young and 
have been lured from rural areas by the promise of better 
health care and better schools. The new parks will be built on 
the site of a former military base, where thousands 
of American troops were stationed during the civil war. 

The park is one way to encourage local leaders to push for changes to 
strengthen the existing infrastructure that has protected it. 

In recent months the city has been caught up in a political battle 
over housing: a lawsuit by two pro-gun groups, the 
Chicago Police Officers Association and the Cook County 
Police Department (cpd), alleging discrimination. 

A group called MoveOn, an advocacy group, is pushing for a re- 
write of the code to make it easier for people to sue cities when they 
claim that they discriminate against them. It wants to change the law so that it 
does not apply to all public places, including parks, but also to private 
property. Its aim is to force the city to provide proper safeguards to 
protect its residents
