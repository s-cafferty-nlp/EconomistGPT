TEXT OUTPUT:The new president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, is 
a former prime minister. He will be the first to 
have served as an elected leader in Ukraine since the ouster of 
Ukraine’s president, Viktor Yanukovych. But he has been a presi- 
dent since 2012 and will have little time to rejoin the 
European Union. His successor will have to navigate 
his way through his political career 
through the turbulent waters of his own 
country, which he has spent much of his time 
trying to navigate. 

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Mr 
Kremchak said that if the EU was going to 
take on Russia, it would not want to risk a confrontation 
with the West. Yet many Ukrainians are wary of this. In 
the past two years Mr Putin has made it clear that he is 
not keen on the European Union, but there is little sign that it will 
reject him. On December 29th Mr Putin told a meeting of the Eu’s 
Commission for the Eu that he did not believe that the bloc could co-operate in 
a peaceful way with Russia, and promised that Russia would not accept any 
aid from Europe or America. It is unlikely to do so without help from Brussels. 

A more important question is whether the new leaders will be able to 
resolve the country’s crisis by themselves. The pro-Russia movement 
has gained strength in eastern Ukraine, where it has won support 
from both the east and the west. A large number of Poles, especially 
young ones, have become disillusioned with Mr Putin. In 2014 the far-right 
Party for the People's Republic of Crimea, which has ruled since 
2003, took power in Donetsk. Its supporters see him as a re- 
mote to the Russian dream of a free Europe that is 
not only closer to Russia but also a sign of its weakness. 

In recent months pro-Russian politicians in Poland, 
Poland and Hungary have joined forces to form a new coalition to 
preserve the region from Russian inves- 
sion. That could lead to an end to the war that started in 2013 between the 
separatists and the pro-Russia rebels. And if the West does not accept this, it will be hard to 
get a deal on Ukraine’s future. 

The two sides are trying to find a way out of this dilemma. Both parties are 
looking for ways to get through the crisis without losing their old allies. They want 
to avoid a repeat of the conflict in the past. 

Yet there is one area of agreement: the EU itself. It has been 
more assertive than ever before in its pursuit of eastern and 
European integration. This time around, however, Germany is less willing 
to play politics with Moscow than it was in the days of the Berlin Wall. It may 
be reluctant to go further into Ukraine than it used to be, but it is confident it can 
make progress. 

Mr Schumpeter is right. The Kremlin will still try to keep him out 
of office. But if he wins, the new president will 
have to find a way to make the case for his re- 
sponse to the West against Moscow. He will have to persuade Europe’s par- 
liament to reject a deal that would have let Russia retain access to 
the European Union’s borders and open borders. That would 
give Russia a chance to win back support from other powers, such as Britain, 
France, Germany and Italy, which want to see Ukraine transformed into a 
partner state on their own. In return, Mr Putin will also have to persuade Russia to take 
its side against Western sanctions imposed in retaliation for 
Russia’s annexation of Crimea. 

Mr Schumpeter's successor will face a tougher fight in 2018, when he faces an elec- 
tronous election. As part of the campaign, Mr Macron will try to push his anti-Putin pro-EU 
message through parliament, which could give him the chance to use his power to 
reach across the centre-right coalition of his party, Marine Le Pen, 
to push her through parliament and secure a majority. His main rival, Jean-Marie Le Pen, 
who is also a former interior minister, is likely to win. 

The result will probably not be so easy. Ms Le Pen, who has long been a 
parliamentarian, would have to find a way to win back votes from voters 
who are sceptical of her centrist credentials. Her niece, Marion 
Fernandez, the niece of a popular mayor, has 
pledged to “make France more democratic”, and she may well need to get her hands on at least half of the 
parliament—which will require her to win a second term in 2017. 

But if Mr Macron wins, it will be the first time since his election last year 
in May 2016 that a president has managed to break into such a narrow lead without a 
political breakthrough. The next election in 2021 will be the first since the fall of 
the Berlin Wall in 1989, when Angela Merkel, the chancellor, won her first 
presidential election. And Mr Macron will have a chance to become Europe’s 
first president after a third round of voting. 

Mr Macron’s victory will be a blow to Mrs Merkel, whose conservative CDU 
(conservative Christian Democrats) will want a new prime minister. He will be an ally of Ms Le Pen, who has 
promised to bring together parties that are split along 
the centre and centre-right, but also to make up the centre-left. 

Her opponents will be far less enthusiastic
