TEXT OUTPUT:A new generation of Italian 
teachers is being trained by the same 
schools in Italy as well as elsewhere. In- 
vented in the 1990s, they are teaching at schools 
in Sicily and Sicily's southern cities, 
with the aim of improving their teaching 
through pedagogy. Their pupils learn English, 
Italian, French, Spanish, Italian, Spanish, German and 
Polish. The pupils also learn to read, write and 
learn how to cook in school and to read at home. They also 
learn to walk in the street and talk in public 
schools. Teachers will have a chance to develop the skills 
that make them successful teachers. It is not just 
that the pupils are learning how to work and play 
together. Many of them are already learning to live in small 
houses that are often empty and filthy. 

They will be able to earn a living doing the things they love, 
such as farming, cleaning, selling food and making wine, 
and will also be able to get a good education in other countries. 

The new pupils will also have the opportunity to become leaders 
of a movement to improve education for the poor and to build a stronger 
European Union, which will help them gain access to better jobs. 

Italy’s government has set up a fund to help children from all over the 
world who need it. The idea is to provide free tutoring and training to 
children with disabilities. 

But many parents fear that such a scheme would be too 
politically risky. A study by the National Education Association 
found that nearly one-third of pupils who received 
a grant were given a voucher for private schools in 2013. 

That may not seem like much. But the vouchers, which are 
used to finance school lunches, are still 
much less popular than vouchers in most rich 
countries. So the government may want to make 
the vouchers more widely available 
for all. It also wants to encourage families to get 
out of poverty faster and more easily. 

The government’s strategy is to encourage families to attend more 
schools. That means they will have fewer choices. 

A big reason is the fact that the voucher system has been 
slow to catch up with other public education. Many poor countries 
have no official public education system at all. 
And the new vouchers have little effect on local schools. Some 
of the poorest districts do well in secondary schools, but only when 
there is enough money to cover the cost of textbooks and fees. 

Yet some districts have high rates of truancy, often because 
they lack any formal or informal education systems. And the 
new vouchers will not fix this problem. 

It is unclear how to improve the quality of education in poorer 
countries. In the United States, for example, there is evidence that 
some parents spend much time in private schools rather than 
in public ones, even though many private schools are in poor places. 

Many parents think they can afford to go to public schools 
and thus become voucher-holders. They worry that the new vouchers 
will make it harder for them to find a better 
school or to get their children into private schools. 

The most likely solution, says David 
Gorman, an economist at the University of Colorado at Denver, is to 
make vouchers mandatory for all voucher-holders. The law 
would require school districts to collect a voucher-holder’s income and 
assess its impact on educational attainment. But Mr Gorman reckons that this will 
not happen until the next federal election in 2020, with the 
firm expected to hold a vote in November on whether to expand voucher-holders. 

Some states have already begun to take action, but they do so without the help of 
government subsidies. Many more will be needed before vouchers become a 
common option for every family in America. 

In Colorado, for instance, the legislature has been slow to act. It has not 
procedured to pass any legislation since 2013, when a ballot initiative 
against it failed. That was partly because of a failure to repeal the state's 
law on vouchers. But legislators in Colorado have yet to come up with a plan 
that will allow charters to be used for all purposes: vouchers must 
be distributed to everyone who attends a public school within 30 miles of 
Colorado Springs. 

There are some practical ways to reduce the impact of voucher- 
ing, including increasing access to public schools by allowing char- 
ters to operate only in private schools and by making them 
easier for people to obtain vouchers. One is to make vouchers 
available to anyone at all, rather than just those attending 
schools. The other is to make charters less likely to discriminate 
against children of low-income families. Charities can still 
make donations to charities that help poor children get free food 
and medical care; they can even provide financial aid to parents 
who choose to attend private schools. And charters could offer 
some protection from discrimination, too. If a voucher is given to someone at 
a local school or a charter school, it can be used for any purpose. 

One way to boost adoption rates is to give vouchers to non-profits. In- 
vestment firms have begun offering vouchers for child care. Some 
public schools in Denver have opened their doors to voucher- 
ing, which means that voucher-holders will receive vouchers for services they need. 

Another is to encourage more adoption. Many states now allow 
children to adopt after birth. This may not mean 
more people adopt but it would encourage more adoption. A recent 
study by the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children 
in Washington, D.C. found that adoption rates for both black and 
white American children fell by 1
