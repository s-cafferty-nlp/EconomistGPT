CITY OF LAS VEGAS’S capital, Las Vegas, was the site of a huge 
show of force on April 29th when two giant 
motorcycles and an assault rifle-wielding cop- 
ered the opening salvo in a fight that left one police officer 
with life-threatening injuries. The event was one of the largest 
shows of its kind in the country 
and was a blow to the pro-democracy cause. In America, 
the city had been a beacon of civil unrest for 
many years until the late 1980s. 

The first such show of force came in 1989, when a pair of 
police officers ambushed and killed a man who was driving 
into a crowd of protesters at the Plaza El Chapo, a 
protest site near Las Vegas’s Strip. 

In a year that saw protests over police killings in Ferguson, Mo., 
the violence in Las Vegas and other cities has become the most violent 
festival in America. Last month, as a crowd gathered to watch a video 
of a white supremacist beating a black teenager, a young boy was shot dead by 
two cops in Virginia. And in 2014 a police shooting in California killed a man 
who had been arrested for allegedly assaulting a black driver. 

Las Vegas is now the world’s largest city of gun ownership, but it has also 
been the scene of some of the deadliest shootings in American 
history. Since 2008 more than 150 people have been killed, 
according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial 
Foundation, a group that advocates for law enforcement reform. 

Las Vegas, which has a population of nearly 1.6m, is home to some of the most lethal 
guns in America. But it has also had two of the nation’s deadliest 
across-the border. The shooting at a Sikh temple in 
Colorado on January 9th by a white supremacist 
turned violent rampage that left eight dead and more than 
1,000 injured has caused outrage across America. In Colorado 
police say they are investigating whether the shooters were 
outgunned or simply targeted by an armed man with a gun. 

But Las Vegas's police chief, David Bratton, who is in charge 
of policing the city, has yet to respond to a spate 
of murders in recent years. On January 31st a gunman shot and killed a policeman 
in a crowded bar, killing three cops. And in October a white 
man fatally shot and wounded four black officers at an unarmed 
rally near the state capitol in Ferguson, Mo. In 2013 a white police officer was killed 
in a shootout with a black teenager after he refused to drop his weapon. 

Yet despite these setbacks, guns remain a big part of the culture of gun- 
free zones in America. 

In the 1970s many states passed laws making it easier to buy guns 
from licensed private sellers; now most states require that they be 
sold only to licensed individuals. In Texas, for instance, all 
licensed handguns must be registered by July 1st. 

The law also required that any person with a permit 
be fingerprinted before being allowed to own a gun, and required 
gun shops to carry identification 
along with a photo ID. The state legislature has yet to 
pass a bill to do so. 

Some states are trying to shift the burden of proof 
off to local police, who are more likely to find them 
than criminals. New York, for example, is moving to 
charge people with misdemeanors with no prior history of criminal 
charges, rather than felonies, as it does with guns. It has also tried to 
make it easier for people with pre-existing mental illnesses to obtain 
guns from licensed dealers. 

These efforts may prove fruitless, though. Some states have been re- 
cently doing just that. A study published last year by the University of 
Colorado found that only 12% of Americans were legally able to own a gun, 
and that those who did not had a permit to use them at all. This suggests that 
there is little reason to worry about how much guns will become 
common in the future. 

State legislatures are also shifting their focus away from guns. On 
March 31st, legislators in Washington, D.C., introduced a bill that would make 
requiring a background check for all gun purchases 
an essential condition for obtaining a gun. 

A similar law in California was passed by the same 
house last year, but failed to gain enough votes to 
pass. The new bill, however, will allow 
the state to require gun-buyers to provide a photo ID 
with every purchase they take. A federal court in New 
York recently ruled that such a requirement should be applied 
only to those who show proof of a criminal record. In 
Washington, meanwhile, a federal judge has blocked a law 
that allows people to carry concealed handguns 
in public places. But even so, it is hard to imagine any other country 
making this change without some sort of national ban on assault weapons. 

The next step could be a law that bans people from buying guns in 
any other state or territory, which could have a big effect. It would also 
require a fingerprint test to be taken before being licensed. 

Some states are starting to adopt more sensible ways to handle guns, too. 
In Colorado, for example, voters in 2012 approved a bill that 
would have allowed police to stop citizens with a history of mental-health 
related problems if they were convicted of an assault. That bill now 
would give them a right to possess a weapon only if they 
know that someone has been involuntarily committed to a hospital. 

States may soon follow suit
