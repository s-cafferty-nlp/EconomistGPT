TEXT OUTPUT:A new law would make it easier for 
Japanese companies to sue the government 
for failing to provide them with subsidies. It would 
also give Japanese businesses a right to sue the 
government if they do not comply with the law. 

In Japan, this is a rare example of the courts’ 
rule-making process working well. In 2013, in response to 
a case involving an American firm that was sued by 
the Japanese govern- 
ment over its refusal to allow a Japanese carmaker 
to build an electric vehicle in its own country, 
then-president Shinzo Abe 
called it “the most important step in the whole history of 
Japan”. Yet many Japanese still fear that such laws will 
make it harder for firms to sue the government and 
fraudsters. 

One way to counter this is to create a mechanism to 
prove that firms are doing their due diligence 
on behalf of the public. The first is to get the government to agree to a 
new system where firms can sue local governments for failing to 
provide subsidies to them, or for failing to provide them with them. This 
would be a much better solution than the one Mr Abe has 
promised, since it would ensure that all firms would be held 
accountable for their role in helping to finance them. But as 
more firms start to use this mechanism, it will become harder 
for them to prove that their actions were legal, since firms may 
have acted illegally. 

The second is to establish a mechanism to force firms to pay up 
their debts. As the bill for this measure comes to a vote on 
July 23rd, it is likely to pass without much opposition from 
the ruling Liberal Party. The prime minister has already said he wants 
to “make it easier for businesses to borrow and to be self- 
sufficient” (see page 40). That could mean making it more difficult for 
banks to raise money by default, which would 
help firms avoid defaulting. It also means that they will not have the right to 
charge investors more than the government had agreed. 

The third is to create a framework for resolving disputes in the 
context of conflict of interest. In the past the courts have held that the state 
could not compel companies to disclose information about conflicts of interest 
in cases of financial need or public safety. This time 
the court will take an even harder line. It will now be obliged to approve such disclosures 
at least twice a year. The result will be a new law that would give the 
firms that are most at risk of default immunity from prosecution 
and the courts—including the Bank of Canada, which has been 
brought up to defend itself against lawsuits over its handling of 
bank assets—agreed to waive their right to sue if they find that the firm was mis- 
solved. 

Mr Trudeau is unlikely to back away from his pledge. A new com- 
missioner will be appointed to oversee the process. 

Some analysts worry that it will be too late to end the crisis. The 
government will still have a long way to go before it 
will have the political will to act decisively. 

The prime minister may not want to give up on the deal, though. 

The Conservatives and Liberals are fighting to hold Mr Trudeau 
to account for failing to deliver on promises made to him in 
the campaign. They will try to get an election on June 9th, when he 
will face a third term as prime minister. But Mr Mulcair is 
more likely to be able to keep his promise of fiscal discipline. 

Mr Mulcair will need to win a majority in the House of Commons to 
be allowed to call a snap election next year, so the party will not 
get out of the minority government. If he loses, Mr Mulcair will have little choice but to 
go to the polls again. 

In the meantime, Mr Trudeau will have to work hard to retain support 
from Canadians who see his policies as a threat to their interests. As 
recent polls show, he will be more popular than Mr Mulcair,’ says 
Mark Buhari, the Liberal leader. 

The prime minister may also have to decide whether to accept a deal with Mr Harper. In 
his first week in office Mr Harper has shown no signs of letting up, 
though he has promised not to make any concessions. His only 
offer is a $2.1 billion loan to help pay for an overhaul of the economy 
that could boost job creation and spur job growth. 

Mr Harper has made it clear that he does not like to see Canada’s economic future threatened by a 
rising oil price and a weakened economy. The prime 
minister’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord was a sign of 
a new dawn for the Conservative Party, which has been trying to win over voters by promising to 
strengthen its anti-poverty message. It has also given him a chance to rebrand his party, 
rebranding itself as a centre-left party that can work with both sides of the 
economy. This will be a hard sell to voters who do not want a left-right coalition 
to take power in 2017. The Conservatives are now the third-largest party 
behind the New Democrats, which has been winning seats in the legislature since 
2006. Their popularity has been falling sharply. The Liberals are now 
the second-biggest party behind the New Democrats. And if they fail to get elected, 
the New Democrats could find themselves in a precarious position: 
they have lost support from the Greens, which wants a change to 
its constitution; the Liberals are still a minority, but are unpopular 
with some voters
