ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: CAIRO


TEXT OUTPUT:I N THE early 1980s a group of young Egyptian 
women in Cairo were busily working as maids 
and maids at the main Egyptian factory. 
They had to navigate a labyrinth of bureaucracy and 
dorms in which they often faced death and 
involuntary servitude. In some places, however, they were forced to work 
as servants. They had to learn to read, write and 
study Arabic for their masters, and to study the Koran 
for their husbands. 

The women who became maids did so because they were not 
allowed to go home without a permit. 

In Egypt today, this is a huge shift in 
Egypt’s political landscape. The economy 
is in its most fragile state, with no public transport 
 or health services. As the population ages, it will be harder 
to keep up with the growth of tourism and the rise of 
the internet. And when people start moving away, many will end up 
in poor families, where they may struggle to feed themselves. 

The new generation of Egyptians are desperate for better pay and 
better education. Many find the government's subsidies 
unworkable. They complain that they can barely afford to buy basic goods 
such as electricity and food. They worry about losing their jobs if 
they get caught in the back of the bus, and about the risk of having their homes 
taken over by foreign powers. 

Many have moved abroad. Most of them live in 
poor neighbourhoods. Some have fled to neighbouring countries like 
Jeddah and Sinai. 

Many Egyptians are still living on welfare, even though the 
economy has been weak since the revolution. 

Some have returned to work but are struggling to find a new home. 

In Egypt, the government is now trying to 
bring back some 300,000 families whose lives 
have been ruined by civil war and subsequent 
reforms. It has tried to make it easier for people 
to get married, but many have refused. 

Many of the migrants who were supposed to be 
willing to stay there are instead stuck in camps in Libya and 
Syria, which have become more dangerous. 

Some have gone into hiding, hoping that they can escape the violence 
of the past decade or so and find a new life in the country. Others 
seem desperate and desperate to leave. The government is trying to 
send out its best-equipped soldiers to help them. But Mr Sisi’s army 
has also cracked down on dissent. In October he ordered his own army 
to seize all media outlets critical of Egypt’s government, and to 
charge those who publish articles critical of the president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. 

The government may not want to see this go unpunished. On April 1st it 
sent an army officer, Mohamed Abu Eman, to jail on trumped up charges 
of inciting the murder of a police officer. He is being held at 
home without charge. 

Egypt’s rulers will try to contain the wave of 
deaths in Sinai by building up an army 
and intelligence apparatus that can counter the Islamist 
propaganda machine. They will also try to hold back the re- 
gime from using the Sinai as a base for its military. It is 
hard to know how much power these new outfits will have. 

A growing number of Egyptian politicians 
are worried that Egypt’s leaders are too soft on Islamist 
propaganda. One politician is calling on the state to help Egypt fight 
terrorism, but he fears that the country’s security services will be more 
in touch with Islamists than they are with Egyptians. 

Some Egyptians fret that the generals are too timid to take part in the 
fight against the Islamists. A few months ago the generals 
feared that if they were to start a war against the Islamists, they might even 
be able to use Egypt as a staging area for an attack. 

Egyptian generals worry about a future in which the Islamists 
would be able to expand their influence across the country. 

They will find it hard to resist the temptation to turn a blind eye to 
the spread of Islamist propaganda in the Sinai, especially 
against Egypt’s most important ally, Israel. The 
newspaper accounts of the killings suggest that at least three 
other people were killed. The government blamed 
the attackers on Egyptian security forces and 
the army. It was unclear whether any of these had been 
targeted. 

On the same day, the president tweeted that the new year would bring 
more pressure on Egypt to change its attitude towards al- 
Qaeda. In an attempt to appease his critics, Mr Morsi 
has called for an end to the war against the jihadists. 

But many Egyptians still fret over the role that Islamist groups play in 
Egypt’s rise. A poll last month found that only 31% of Egyptians thought 
they could trust them. And some fear that if they do not, the Islamists will be emboldened by a re- 
gion of the Brotherhood’s charismatic leader, Mohamed Morsi, who is 
popularly considered the most powerful man in Egypt. 

In the West, however, the threat of a more assertive America looms large. 
America is worried about how much the Brotherhood has changed 
in recent years. Its leaders have become more sophisticated, more assertive 
and more assertive. They have shown little sign of letting go. Last year the group 
launched a series of attacks in Sinai and Cairo, and has now killed 
more than 500 people in the city and towns it controlled
