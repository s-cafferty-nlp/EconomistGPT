ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: KATHMANDU


TEXT OUTPUT:A new wave of Chinese investment 
is beginning to take shape, and in some cases the 
most exciting. The first is a surge in Chinese-made 
electricity projects, which have begun to attract 
Chinese capital. This has spurred Chinese companies to invest 
in startups that will be able to compete with those of 
the West’s most advanced firms, such as Huawei, 
which has built up a network of factories and 
has set up factories in China. 

The next wave will see big investments from 
big Western firms like Rolls-Royce and 
Airbus, which want to build fleets of aircraft and 
to use them for commercial purposes. 

These are not just the kind of places to get tech talent; it 
is also the place to start investing. 

In recent months, though, investors have taken advantage of the 
newness of Chinese energy markets to invest in startups 
that promise to change how businesses operate, from carmaking to 
health care. In cities like Beijing, where electricity is 
increasingly cheap, there is talk of a boom in small-scale manufacturing 
that will help spur innovation and entrepreneurship. 

Some of this is due to a shift away from big American firms in 
the form of Chinese conglomerates that dominate China’s power industries. 

This is not just because of America’s growing influence over the poli- 
cy of its economy. It is also because China is now more likely to buy 
things that are cheaper and more effective than others. In many 
developed countries, such as India, for example, the cost of producing 
a product is often higher than buying one that does not. 

The biggest reason for the rise in price of food has come from 
the spread of online services. The internet has become the gov- 
ernment’s second-biggest source of information about 
our lives and our places, enabling it to tap into the deepest pockets of 
the population. This shift may be a sign that people have moved away from 
buying things online rather than on their own. 

A recent study by the Centre for Food Policy Research at the 
University of California at Berkeley found that in the past year only 
one in three American households had paid for food through an online- 
payment service (see chart). That was down from two-thirds of all Americans in 2013, when 
the number of Americans who used these services rose by nearly 1.2%. 

That could change if consumers start using digital tools like 
cooking apps or shopping websites instead, which can be bought 
and sold directly via the web. 

There is no shortage of good news for farmers, too. A third of 
farmers say they use mobile devices less than once a week. And the share of Ameri- 
can households with smartphones 
has risen dramatically since 2015. As with food, this will depend partly 
on how much time farmers spend online. 

One explanation is that consumers are increasingly turning to 
digital platforms to make purchases. They are starting to pay for them 
with more money and faster delivery. 

Some may be tempted to buy from an app-store like 
Amazon or eBay, which offer cheaper prices, but they 
have little interest in buying products on the go. Some have already started 
selling goods directly to their homes via e-commerce. 

The rise of social-media platforms has also made it easier to sell 
things online. Apps can be downloaded at any time and re- 
quired by anyone—from friends to family members. But most of these apps 
are aimed at people who are busy shopping and work, not 
those who are just looking for new things. 

This makes it hard for companies to keep pace, especially when it comes to 
the amount of data users need to store to manage a huge number of 
pages. The big American firms such as Google and Microsoft 
are now developing systems to store vast amounts of data. 

Many of those who use social-media tools still rely on them for 
business. In some cases they simply cannot do it. 

That is changing. Many tech giants are investing in 
cloud services. Cloud providers, which run cloud 
computing systems, are growing quickly. Amazon, which 
is developing its own, is building its own. Apple is 
working to build a similar platform. Others are building 
cloud-computing systems for businesses that use cloud 
services. Some of the biggest firms are already working with 
cloud-computing giants such as IBM and Intel, 
which have their own cloud-computing- 
systems. The big companies are also trying to find ways to make 
them more profitable, by offering services to small 
companies, which can then use them to create more value. 

Some of these firms will be better able to deal with the huge costs of 
cloud computing than others. 

The big firms’ business model is complex and unpredictable. But 
it works. As the technology grows, so does the ability to innovate. It has 
been a long time since many big firms were innovating in the way 
they did. They now want to work with other big firms to help them grow, 
to learn how to scale up, to develop new products and services, to 
build products and services that compete with those of smaller ones. 

They need to get ahead. If they fail, there is little chance they will be able to 
make it again. That is partly because firms are increasingly relying 
on software that they themselves do not yet know how to use. 

Many startups hope to find ways to adapt. One is 
cloud. Its founders believe that it can be used to help people navigate 
the digital world. It allows them to search for content faster than 
a computer could
