TEXT OUTPUT:A TURN to the right can be a painful one. 

On July 1st, the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau 
of Canada and Alberta 
announced a $3 billion investment in infrastructure 
and new jobs, including a new rail network that will make up about half of 
the province’s population. It is an ambitious move, but it does not 
do much to change the fortunes of a small town 
that was once home to a thriving oil industry. 

But the Liberals have also promised to build 
a new transit network, which will bring in more than 3,000 new 
passengers a day. And their plan to build a railway between 
Toronto and Vancouver has been a big boon for the city. 
The Conservatives are eager to re-elect a prime minister who 
has shown little interest in making his party stand up to 
the left, and will try to keep them on the right side of the aisle. 

For all his talk of transforming a region into a centre for pro-business politi- 
cians, the Liberals have long relied on a loose coalition of provincial 
parties to govern. The Liberals have won just three of the 13 provincial 
presidential elections since 2006. But they are still in power at the elec- 
tion, and may find themselves unable to turn things around without a constitu- 
tion in place to take office in 2017. 

The Liberals have a better chance of winning a majority of seats in the 
Alberta legislature, as well as in Quebec, if they manage to secure enough seats 
in the upper house. That would mean Mr Trudeau will be the first 
Liberal leader to win a majority of both houses of Parliament. He 
will need to convince voters that he is serious about re- 
sponding to the long-term challenges facing his party and 
that his government is on the right track. 

Mr Trudeau has not been shy about attacking the Conservatives’ 
right to govern, even though it is hard to see him doing so 
without alienating voters from his centre-right base. In the elec- 
tion, he has pledged to reform the tax code and to make 
taxpayers pay for health care, education, transport and other services. His plan 
would also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020. 

Yet his main task will be to contain the threat of a new election 
in 2019, which will give Mr Harper a chance to reshape the Conservative Party. 

His Liberal Party has a lot of potential, but it will struggle to retain power until 2021. If 
it fails, he will face a difficult choice: to lead an opposition coalition that includes 
his father and former prime minister, Jean Chrétien, who has little time for politics. 

If he does not, the Liberals will struggle to keep hold of power in 2021. The next general election in 2021 
will be much harder. 

The Conservatives are already losing ground. A recent poll showed them trailing the Liberals 
and New Democrats, which had just two seats. They are now 
worth less than half what they were at the start of the year. 

The Liberal party has been badly weakened by the fall in oil prices and a re- 
turn to the franc, which was once thought to be 
a good thing for Canada. The country’s economy has grown by 2.3% this year, 
and the prime minister’s popularity has plummeted. 

In the short term, however, Mr Trudeau’s government’s prospects for success will be stronger than it is 
for Mr Mulcair. It will have to find a new leader to replace him. 

Mr Mulcair may be the best chance of keeping his promise to scrap the federal 
budget, but his message is more resonant than the one from Mr Mulcair. 

Mr Trudeau has been unusually effective in persuading Canadians that their 
country’s problems are not as big as some might think. He has promised to 
bring about economic reform. In return for his support, Mr Mulcair would 
give the Liberals the upper hand in elections on November 8th. His main rival, 
Justin Trudeau, is an experienced politician with experience of dealing with crises. 

The other potential contender is Jean Chrétien. The former premier 
has long been a centre-right centrist. He is popular in Quebec and 
can attract voters with his populist brand. Yet he has lost his appeal among 
his own supporters in the past four years, and the Conservatives are likely to try to re- 
cognise him as a centrist who can win back support from voters. 

If Mr Trudeau succeeds in keeping Mr Mulcair 
in power, he will have a harder time gaining traction elsewhere, as 
he does in Canada’s big cities, where he has made good use of his 
political capital. His government has struggled to balance its budget, and his 
government is struggling to balance its budget-the Liberals will struggle to keep up with the 
Liberal party. And if Mr Trudeau loses the next election, it could spell trouble for the Liberal Party. 

In any case, there are two possible paths to victory for Mr Trudeau. One is to 
make the Liberals look like an old party that has not been around much longer. 

Mr Trudeau’s first chance to get rid of Mr Mulcair may be to shift the focus away from the 
prime minister. But that may be too risky. For all the talk about a “grand bargain” between 
Canada and the European Union, Mr Trudeau’s new government has done little to advance 
its interests. It will also lose votes in Quebec and Alberta, which both 
have strong pro-European and anti-euro wings. 

There is some hope that Mr Trudeau could find some of the strength he craves from 
a conservative prime minister by winning back Canadians who voted for him in 2012
