ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: SYDNEY


TEXT OUTPUT:SOME countries are trying to 
make it easier for them to get their 
businesses in touch with foreign investors. In- 
vestors have a lot of incentive to invest in the tech 
industry, but many fear that they may find out too late if 
they fail to do so. 

A new law will soon allow companies to set up 
their own offices abroad. That could 
help them to attract more foreign investment in the 
economy. But as China’s economy has grown, its 
producers have been caught in a vicious cycle 
of consolidation, which can lead to a sudden de- 
spite of a boom in new businesses. 

The government has tried to curb the spread of 
the virus by encouraging firms to open new ones in 
the country rather than just opening one at home. It is also 
trying to encourage companies to invest in local infrastructure 
as much as possible and make it easier to grow. 

In other parts of the world, however, the pandemic has had a 
big effect. As the number of Chinese expats has fallen from 
2.7m in 2012 to 1.5m now, there has been a sharp rise in emigration 
from China. A big reason is that many of those leaving are not 
Chinese. Their parents moved to Australia when the country was still 
a poor place. And since then, some have gone to Hong Kong or 
China. Many are now coming from countries where the mainland 
is less rich and relatively safe. The exodus has hit 
many of the poorest, who have little hope of escaping. 

Many are fleeing because of high inflation, low prices and 
a shortage of labour. Some are lured into emigration by 
the promise of cheap foreign labour. But they are not alone. 

Some are also drawn from the old system: migrants 
who arrive in the West often face a long period of 
disproportionate work. As many as 1,600 Chinese-born 
were born abroad in 2015. In some places, that is much lower. 

Many of them have been brought to Britain from China, which 
is not far behind. Mr Cameron’s government has pledged to re- 
form its immigration system, but there has been little progress. 

The numbers of Britons leaving Britain will rise further. It may take until 2020 to get back on track. 

But if all these newcomers are allowed to stay, it could be an opportunity to 
help shape future generations. 

Britain's growing middle class can help it do better. The economy 
has improved over the past decade. The share of the working-age population aged 25-64 has 
been flat, at just 15%. In the last census, only 13% of those 65 and older had 
any education; today, more than half of those with no college 
have one. A recent study by the University of Nottingham, for example, found that 
only 3% of young people had any degree. By 2025, according to the 
University of Oxford, nearly three-quarters of new immigrants will be from 
countries with less stringent immigration rules. But there is little sign of a 
decline in crime. The number of foreigners who have been re- 
sulted in Britain has fallen by 1.5% since 2001. 

Some of this is caused by the rise of online platforms such as 
Yelp, which allows users to search for information on their 
own terms, rather than being forced to pay for it. Some of these sites 
are also designed to make it easy for firms to find 
themselves among the rich, but some are not even designed to work for them. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that the country’s high fertility rate has 
made it difficult for firms to attract workers from abroad. So it is hard to recruit new 
workers from abroad. As a result, fewer foreign students attend school. 

In Britain, where many English-speaking countries offer a higher share of 
students than America, an increase in the proportion of French-speaking 
teachers has made it harder for newcomers to gain permanent residency. 

Yet Mr Renzi’s plan to crack down on illegal emigration seems likely to 
be a success. Many migrants are unlikely to return to the city after they 
remain in the countryside for much longer. 

There are signs of hope that Europe’s recovery will accelerate. Last year, as 
much as 6m people were sent back to France from 
other countries. The number of asylum-seekers in Britain rose by 
10m last year, to more than 3.6m, but there have been fewer 
than 2,000 evictions and deportations since 
2015. In Germany, the number of asylum-seekers has risen by nearly 
two-thirds between 2014 and 2016. 

The EU’s response to this wave of migration is not as simple as it seems. On 
the continent, however, many of the biggest problems are far more complex. 

For example, the rise of the euro crisis and the subsequent recession 
have brought new arrivals with little chance of reintegration into the 
community. But the share of newcomers who arrive from other European countries has 
also fallen sharply. 

In the first few months of 2017, the number of asylum-seekers in France 
rose by almost two-thirds; in the second half of the year by about 1.1%. 

A bigger reason is that the influx of new arrivals has accelerated the 
flow of new workers to places such as France, where most are 
from. That is partly because firms have taken better care of their workers
