TEXT OUTPUT:The new law would 
set up a new “digital currency”, which 
would allow for digital transactions 
in the same way as traditional currencies. 

This would be an attempt to change that. In theory it is 
the first such digital currency to be created in 
the world, but in practice it would require a new 
form of payment system. The current system uses a 
centralised system of checks and balances, with 
a centralised authority 
which can only issue money by mail or fax. 

It would also give the authorities more leeway to 
allow banks and credit unions to lend 
to businesses, allowing them 
to operate in a more transparent manner than before. 

The changes would not have much impact on existing 
banks, however. The government has been trying to re- 
form the banking system since 2007 to make it more open, 
and to simplify its processes. It will try to keep some banks out of 
the system, but it is unlikely to be able to replace them all. 

There are other obstacles to this plan. It could create a huge 
problem for big companies that rely on cash to do business. Some 
are already struggling to get financing from abroad. 

In addition to these problems, the law would put pressure on 
big banks to find ways to expand their operations without incurring 
costs or having to raise taxes. 

Some big banks have already begun looking at how to adapt. In 
recent weeks they have been working on a deal to merge 
with JPMorgan Chase & Co, an American bank that had invested 
in bitcoin. They have been working with a group of private-equity 
firms to develop a strategy to buy up some of the biggest 
banks in America, and are also looking at other firms to 
invest in bitcoin. The companies will also be trying to get regulators to take 
their own advice about how to deal with emerging 
market demand for cash, as well as to help them understand how to manage 
their debts better. 

The next step is to start using more of the same sort of data to 
monitor what happens when big banks fail. That could include 
whether they use bitcoin to make transactions less risky, 
and whether it is used to monitor how much people spend on purchases, and 
how much they pay back for them. But these problems are not insurmount- 
ing, especially if banks try to use them to reduce costs and improve performance. 

One possible solution is to shift away from relying on credit-default swaps 
for payments to digital payment systems, which would allow banks to 
charge higher interest rates and charge lower fees to users who do not 
have access to such services. This may help to reduce the risk that 
banks will struggle to keep track of who uses what kind of money. 

Yet there is plenty of evidence that such changes are possible. 

In recent years, financial institutions have increasingly been able to tap into 
the data collected by banks to identify customers, and to 
help them make decisions about where to invest. 

This is not just a new way of doing business, either: in 
a few years it may be even more important than ever for firms 
to understand how their data can be used to shape how they think about 
their businesses. 

A growing number of firms now use data from 
the Fed to manage their portfolios, which allows them to 
prevent conflicts of interest between firms and clients. 

These are good news for big firms because they can be more transparent and 
more accountable to shareholders. And if regulators find that 
they have misused their authority to stifle competition, they can 
do more to rein in abuses, too. 

Some of these reforms might seem radical. Some of the most 
commonly touted measures are to improve oversight of 
banks and to better regulate credit-card transactions. But many of the biggest 
changes will depend on how well these policies work in practice. 

One big change is that some firms now have less incentive to 
make risky bets. They now spend more wisely. In the past 
they could take advantage of a loophole in the rules governing asset-backed 
equity trading. That allowed companies to trade at a discount rather than as 
low as $10,000 per share in stocks. 

Another change is to allow smaller, less risky firms to buy 
themselves out of bigger ones. It was only when hedge-fund funds began 
to invest in such firms that 
they realised how risky investing in them would be. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that 
it is still hard to find a way to get a firm to pay for 
such investments without risking its own financial health. The 
prices of private equity and other public-sector 
equity have been falling since 2007. But investors are wary of 
any sudden increase in interest rates. A recent survey by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission found that just 2% of American households had 
enough cash on hand to buy their first homes; the rest were borrowing from 
other countries with higher interest rates. 

Some investors may also feel that they are losing their faith in America. Some 
investors say they fear that the government will not provide 
more help to them. Mr Trump’s administration has promised to re-open 
the tax code so that it does not discriminate against rich and poor. Its goal, 
presumably, will be to lower the capital gains tax rate on big-city 
wealthy Americans and to cut the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 20%. This 
is one reason why the president has been reluctant to raise taxes 
on high-income earners, particularly those who make up about 10% of the 
economy
