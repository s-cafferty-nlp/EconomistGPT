ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: SINGAPORE


TEXT OUTPUT:A new poll from 

the Economist Intelligence Unit 

has shown that the public view of the 
economy is changing. 

In the latest edition of a poll conducted by 
the institute in October, a majority of respondents said they 
would rather live in a city where 
the public is less concerned with the 
economy than in one with fewer 
producers of oil and gas; 
the share who would rather live in a city with 
less money has fallen by nearly 
half since the year before, to 37%. 

Yet the shift has also been felt in some 
other areas, too: 
the share who favour greater public 
spending on education, the minimum wage, 
the minimum wage, public health care, 
police protection and the environment
