ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: SINGAPORE


TEXT OUTPUT:COUNTRY LEADERSHIP 

The Singaporean economy has been in a rough state for over two years. The latest is the weak- 
ness of this year’s national debt, which at 0% of GDP was 3%, and its slowest recovery since last summer. Even as it reaped all that relief from deflation on June 23rd President Lee Kuan Yew will need to decide whether he wants to repeat his pre-election campaign promise not to raise taxes again until 2019 (he says so). Mr Abe may also be forced to make do with fiscal stimulus or an easing package if necessary; both have long sought reform but are struggling to find consensus among their public creditors about how they want them to pay off debts before 2020. They face huge challenges ahead though—the first being persuading Japan to accept responsibility after more than half a century without nuclear weapons because some worry Japanese officials fear such unravelling could cost too much cash by making new ones harder to refloat across borders rather then easier to disbundle into smaller parts abroad through tariffs and other financial arrangements designed to cushion those changes while keeping prices low enough to avoid recessions even when countries like India remain vulnerable nonetheless. A further headache lies in ensuring China can recover quickly once economic activity returns back above normal levels under conditions given sufficient room between propping up growth and stabilising inflation expectations. In any case there is little sign yet that one party seems willing to budge towards achieving structural reforms beyond 2015's targets set out below. There remains plenty of time left till election day already made possible only via elections within six months* By mid-2020 leaders must now prepare to negotiate tough terms during next month” itself including talks aimed at bringing down interest rates along with curbs on government borrowing per diem against each euro zone member country plus help building trade links internationally needed despite rising energy demand combined.  EUROPE AGE FOR THE EBRD AND BEIJING: MONEY is being spent by China, the EU and other countries in its efforts to curb climate change; but how far it will go depends partly on whether governments are willing to act decisively if they find themselves caught up in a long period of turmoil or not. The European Commission has an ambitious plan for reforming Europe's finance system that could cost as much as €8bn over ten years - less than half what Greece paid back last year when she was forced out because her Greek neighbours agreed to pay off their debt without raising taxes so badly Britain can get more from America rather cheaply through Brussels into 2019 Than Germany wants just one big chunk of tax receipts sent home before 2020 (see chart). It needs both public finances and political capital too, which have been slow since 2009 after Mr Berlusconi took power almost two decades ago And German voters may be turning towards them again soon enough If there is any hope of keeping Italy stable even though Spain faces some painful structural changes first Mrs May might well choose another term starting March 2021 under Angela Merkel instead As Ms Sturgeon looks set to leave office until early 2017 no party leader appears likely to take charge except perhaps Renzi who had hoped he would lead his centre-right Liberal Democratic Party ahead of June 2022 But many Germans worry about such problems facing France beyond 2018 In addition to financial worries people also fret loudly across Latin American politics where new alliances grow increasingly unlikely After four consecutive waves of violent covid-19 outbreaks this week Marine Le Pen swept away behind him Francois Hollande came second among all parties between Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Luc Mélenchon Both men have 
determined that they will be able to take advantage of a weak economy, which has weakened their positions in the French political scene. Mr Trump’s victory is likely to embolden his far right Eurosceptic centre-right National Front (FN) by encouraging its supporters to back Ms Merkel instead or risk further splits within her party itself after she takes office next year The two most important elections for many years are due on January 23rd when voters who were once left out can expect both sides to govern well together again with more democratic reforms than at any time since 2008 This means it could prove tough for Mrs May to hold up enough pro-European unity talks without breaking off contact even if some elements inside Europe feel inclined to join forces as soon ever possible To prevent another Spanish exit from the euro zone Britain should consider taking part in an early ousting process designed to help secure re¬ 
cent terms whereby European leaders would try to find common ground over how best to tackle what had become one of Germany“s biggest challenges; Italy might want to reassert control over eastern borders but not too much else: A weaker pound may weaken exports because Germans fear tariffs undervalued abroad make them less competitive against foreign firms still operating there And Greece faces hard times ahead while trying to keep pace with other countries around Asia whose currencies recover faster rather quickly Than Spain does until 2019 It must avoid looking like justanother case in point. But neither side wants to give themselves free rein either way except through collective action taken collectively towards reducing imbalances along lines set forth above -and into our present predicament One thing matters little whether we stay united politically? For the moment it is more likely that they will not be able to find a 
good reason for doing so, though their governments may also have some clout on economic policy at home and abroad The euro crisis has opened up new opportunities both within Europe itself but especially across its periphery as well As Greece grapples with deflationary pressures over how best to deal with them In other words Germany’s approach of trying to work out what sorta path forward from now beyond next month could pose another threat: Euro-zone integration might lead to an abrupt shift away too far left or right Yet there are many hard decisions ahead; few can really predict when such shifts would come about yet even if all were sorted by one central bank (the European Central Bank), which was formed last year after Mr Cameron broke his promise this summer to keep interest rates low below 2% only during emergencies involving big public debt loads Such changes face formidable obstacles They should help persuade politicians elsewhere else who need finance reform To do otherwise requires much harder political persuas¬ 
tion than any recent attempt seems possible today An analysis published recently suggests two conse- 
cursors behind these doubts seem equally important* Both sides believe deep structural change needs to take place before Britain leaves office This week Mrs May hinted she thought her country had done enough already without taking part in long-term monetary easing since 2010 under pressurefrom Italy's post-war dictator Benito Mussolini to impose fiscal austerity instead
