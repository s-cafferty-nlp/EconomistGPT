ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: SINGAPORE


TEXT OUTPUT:The government has 
taken the lead in trying to bring down a big- 
gest tax evasion scandal. The new rules on corporate chari¬ 
cy are intended to make it harder for them to hide money, and so they will be easier to dodge from state accounts at home—and that is why this week’s election campaign was an important test of how far Singaporeans want their governments to go with reformist reforms now taking place across much of Asia. In recent months many have turned up hungry or thirsty; some may even find themselves seeking jobs elsewhere if not reined into by public service contracts (see chart 2). It also means there is little reason to expect all parties keen to tackle corruption as hard as possible while making sure firms can compete without being caught between entrenched power structures and those who wield huge influence over business affairs abroad. A poll last year found just 37% thought local politicians should govern more directly rather than try to impose too tight polices when dealing head-on with graft problems suchas climate change, which affect people everywhere but China itself. But few believe Mr Renzi's proclamations about curbing corrupting institutions could do any good after two years under his watch despite its flaws. And yet he remains one of India’S most promising young leaders ahead of Narendra Modi, America”s incoming president. His father had been chief executive of General Electric since 1998 before joining Congress* He took office out ofa post held vacant almost 30 years ago until 2001 because both men wanted to see small companies take part in innovation growth again. As well as boosting investment banks around the world, these initiatives help shape countries where rising demand requires high returns like Britain and Mexico. They mean improving governance patterns within rich economies through better coordination among officials involved in trade policy shaping markets beyond Europe and encouraging private sector investments overseas instead of staying outside financial hubs designed to support 
the poorest as a source of revenue for developing nations while fostering innovation that will spur growth elsewhere—and thus provide opportunities across all sectors at home too. For more information on how you can join or learn about our work visit: www
