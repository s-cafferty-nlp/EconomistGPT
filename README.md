# EconomistGPT: AI to Write Articles of the Economist

## The idea here was to use episode titles as prompts in order to generate articles of The Economist. This was a great exercise for understanding the strengths and limitations of decoder architectures.

## Notes on Output: GPTs are spectacular at generating realistic text. The jig is up quite quickly though, when it becomes clear that GPT output contains limited internal logic. Yes, this technology is amazing. Also yes, the hype is excruciating.

ECONOMIST ARTICLE TOPIC: TOKYO


TEXT OUTPUT:

A new law would make it easier for 
Japanese companies to sue the government 
for failing to provide them with subsidies. It would 
also give Japanese businesses a right to sue the 
government if they do not comply with the law. 

In Japan, this is a rare example of the courts’ 
rule-making process working well. In 2013, in response to 
a case involving an American firm that was sued by 
the Japanese govern- 
ment over its refusal to allow a Japanese carmaker 
to build an electric vehicle in its own country, 
then-president Shinzo Abe 
called it “the most important step in the whole history of 
Japan”. Yet many Japanese still fear that such laws will 
make it harder for firms to sue the government and 
fraudsters. 

One way to counter this is to create a mechanism to 
prove that firms are doing their due diligence 
on behalf of the public. The first is to get the government to agree to a 
new system where firms can sue local governments for failing to 
provide subsidies to them, or for failing to provide them with them. This 
would be a much better solution than the one Mr Abe has 
promised, since it would ensure that all firms would be held 
accountable for their role in helping to finance them. But as 
more firms start to use this mechanism, it will become harder 
for them to prove that their actions were legal, since firms may 
have acted illegally.
